`Hi, my name is Rudrrayan, or Rono - welcome to my personal website!`

Here you can find more info on my projects, people or groups I have worked with, and my experiences at various tech events! 

I find writing and explaining things to be very useful, it helps uncloud your mind - especially when you're in the trenches of some problem. I hope this site also helps others with whatever vague or obscure problems they're dealing with!
