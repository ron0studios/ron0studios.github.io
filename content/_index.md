`Hi, my name is Rudrrayan, or Rono`


I am currently in my **second year** at the **University of Southampton**. 


I am a self-taught developer and student. I like `low-level`, `GPUs`, and novel `accelerator tech`. 

---

I got into programming as a kid who loved making games. Nothing interesting would run on my Thinkpad though so I quickly switched to low-level programming to get the speed I needed.

The common thread between all my projects is *performance*. On a single node,  

After learning more about `GPUs` (specifically *GPGPU programming*), I discovered the second dimension of performance -- latency and __**throughput**__.

> I accesed **my first GPU** `October 2024`, [**my first cluster**](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/centres/bristol-supercomputing/articles/2025/isc-student-cluster-competition.html) in `March 2025` and [**my first supercomputer**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/jsc/education/master-students/guest-student-programme) in `August 2025`. 

I scaled from owning performance on single-node programs to see how we can reliably scale code to utilise the bandwidth of `hundreds` of nodes. 

I am currently delving deeper into `HPC`, learning about more niche topics in __`CUDA`__, and working on entirely new compute with **<span style="color:orange">Groq</span>**.

<span style="opacity:60%"> Over the years I've also played around with [cryptography](https://web.archive.org/web/20230315224026/https://thebusinessmagazine.co.uk/esg/southampton-uni-codebreaking-challenge-winners-announced/), competitive programming, audio engineering, and some brief stints with webdev.</span>

Thank you to [Giosuè Sulipano](https://giosuesulipano.it/) for the `not-much` theme which I am currently using for this project!
