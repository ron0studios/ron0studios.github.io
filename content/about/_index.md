I am currently a `full-time student` trying to get my hands in as many sides of Computer Science as I can think of! 

Right now, I am completing my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at the **University of Southampton**. First year tends to give students a `lot` of free time, which I am currently using to explore the subject on my own. The moment I reach the end of one rabbit hole, it always seems like a dozen more are propped up right in front of me... one of the most fun, but daunting, sides of this subject!

Originally drawn in by game development, hacking together platformers, trying to make games in C++ SFML, or participating in game jams, I eventually started branching out into other projects.

## List of works
In the last couple years I have worked on ...

> - Competitive programming ([BIO](https:/olympiad.org.uk), [UKIEPC](https://ukiepc.info/))
>     - SIGCompete: our University's Competitive Programming Society!
>     - British Informatics Olympiad (BIO): Grinding through 20 years of past problems and placing top 30 nationally in the 2023 contest!
>     - ICPC 2024: Our team placed top 5 within the University of Southampton!

> - AI
>     - reinforcement learning/evolutionary algorithms, e.g. [Evolving Cars](https://github.com/ron0studios/Evolving-Cars)
>     - machine learning, e.g [implementing autograd](https://github.com/ron0studios/tensorgrad)
>     - biology-inspired AI (e.g. [Spiking Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network))
> - cipher cracking, e.g. [ciphertools](https://github.com/ron0studios/decipherati-tools) and our team at [The National Cipher Challenge](thebusinessmagazine.co.uk/esg/southampton-uni-codebreaking-challenge-winners-announced/)

> - Web based projects
>     - web development
>     - LLM agent development, e.g detecting early symptoms of mental health conditions
>     - drone swarm control software (Mostly Java, but has some frontend elements to it)
>     - [A web3 sustainability startup](https://www.econex.org.uk/)

> - C++
>     - C++ simulators/scientific software
>     - SFML rendering + game dev
>     - Rendering engines with OpenGL
>     - Aforementioned competitive programming

> - Hackathons 
>     - game jams (GJ): [Benbonk GJ, GMTK GJ (x3), Miz jam](https://ron0studios.itch.io/) and Global Game Jam
>     - hackathons: HackStart, HackSussex, HackUPC, AISoc x IET, SotonHack
>     - Built web3 apps, web scraping/verification tools, agents, CV models etc. etc.

> - high performance computing (HPC) 
>     - Team "BriCS" for the [ISC Student Cluster Competition 2025](https://www.hpcadvisorycouncil.com/events/student-cluster-competition/index.php)!
>     - HPC tuning for the aforementioned LLM agent on [Iridis](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/research/facilities/iridis-research-computing-facility)

...and probably some others I forgot to mention.

## Future

Research seems to be where a lot of my work has been headed - I have spent a large portion of my first year going through research projects or working with lecturers at my university with any extra work they might need offloading. The process of research is exciting, and a subject like Computer Science seems like the most fast-paced and dynamic landscape to embark on! In particular, reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms has been something I have been keen on researching, as well as biologically inspired models such as Spiking Neural Networks. 

In terms of Software and Software development, I have always been fond of C++ and performant code. An industry which facilitates this would be one where I would most want to spend my time in the future. Areas such as Low latency computing, High speed/scalable databases, rendering/graphics programming, or high performance computing seem to be directions I would like to be focused in. 

**`Of course, I am always poking into other parts of my subject, so this list is not mutually exclusive whatsoever!`**
