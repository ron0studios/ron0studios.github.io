# welcome!
> [**AlgoSim**](https://rudrrayan.github.io/AlgoSim/#/) is the website to go to if you want to simulate algorithms!
>
> The goal of this site is to provide a **hassle-free** online interface for running all sorts of algorithmic simulation, from sorting to network flow. We strive to make our service here **free** and **open source** for people to help and contribute!

## Current Status:
- AlgoSim is up and running on github pages! You can check it out [here](https://rudrrayan.github.io/AlgoSim/#/)!. We currently have **disqus** support and our first web app for simulating **DFS**! An article on it will be arriving soon!
