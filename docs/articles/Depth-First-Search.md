# DFS

## Overview

**Depth First Search**, or **DFS**, is a *recursive, graph traversal algorithm*. It follows the principal of **backtracking** to find all nodes reachable from a given source. It is often seen as the *simplest graph traversal algorithm*, but can be used practically in nearly every graph question you find online. 

> **Quick tip:** on [Codeforces](www.codeforces.com), around 1/ 10 problems require you to use DFS in order to solve the problem, that's over 600!

## Process (Pure DFS)

As mentioned earlier, Depth First Search is a backtracking algorithm. We begin with the starting node **A**, which will act as our source. We then loop through all of the connections the nodes makes, and traverse to that node recursively. We keep following this path until we reach a node that *makes no connections*. We then backtrack automatically and continue the loop from the parenting node. With this method, we will have gone through all possible nodes that are reachable from **A**

Here is some C++ pseudocode to help demonstrate:

```c++
void DFS(Node node) //the node class simply contains an array of all its neighbours and its data value (an integer)
{
    for(auto i : node.neighbours)
    {
        DFS(i);
    }
}
```

The method above is a **pure implementation of DFS**. In reality, this version of Depth first search is poor, since we can end up with problems in one of two ways:

- We end up in a cycle
- We are unable to print out the traversed node

## Process (Typical DFS)

A better solution is to have a **visited** list that we can use to check if a certain node can be visited or not, and only traverse to nodes that have not been visited. We can either use a *basic array* in which all the elements are nodes that **have been visited** thus far, or a hash map of all the values with the node as the key, and a *boolean* as for the value. Both methods are viable, however a hash map would give us much better performance with a time complexity of **O(1)** whilst the array based method requires searching and can only yield us a time complexity of **O(N)**, where *N* is the length of the array.

```cpp
void DFS(Node node, unordered_map<Node,bool> visited)
{
    visited[node] = true;
    for(auto i : node.neighbours)
    {
        if(visited[i] == false)
            DFS(i);
    }
}
```

 



## The Simulation

Here is a simulation, *written in [Godot](godotengine.org)*, that goes through the different algorithms for **DFS** discussed in this chapter. You can insert/delete nodes, add edges, and move around. Here is a quick tutorial on how to use it:

- Move around by dragging your mouse
- Double click to create a node, or destroy one. 
- Right click on a node to create an edge from it, right click on another node afterwards. (**Do not do this whilst the simulation is running!**)
- change the speed of the simulation with the slider
- switch between pure and regular DFS with the switch button (**Do not do this whilst the simulation is running!**)
- **If the program crashes, please report it!!!**
