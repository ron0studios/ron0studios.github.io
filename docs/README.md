# Contributing 101

When contributing, besides the [default github guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines), please be sure to be __descriptive__ in your pull-requests and stay __on par__ with the current discussion. I am very early in development, and am willing to take all opinions into consideration!
