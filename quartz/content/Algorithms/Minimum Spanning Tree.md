# Minimum Spanning Tree

>
A minimum spanning tree is a [[tree|tree-structure]] created from a graph, with the sum of all edge weights being minimized.

```ad-warning
A minimum spanning tree does not guarantee the shortest path from any node to the root!
```


## Minimum Spanning Forest
A minimum spanning forest is a set of MST's created from the different components of an overarching graph. For example, if there was a graph of 4 nodes fully connected, and an isolated 5th and 6th node connected, then an MST would be impossible, but a forest of two MST's is liable.
