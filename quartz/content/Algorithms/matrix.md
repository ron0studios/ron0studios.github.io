# Matrix
>
A matrix is a x*y grid, perhaps infinite on any of the 2 planes.

Matrices are useful in a programming context as representing a coordintate plane, or as a table, in [[dynamic programming]]. This is a very generalised definition, since in reality tables and matrices aren't the same thing, but its easier to categorise this way.

Since matrices are often associated with the coordinate plane, a common use of them is as a [[graph#Matrix representation|graph implementation]].

## Tips
- Split a matrix into its x and y components, if a problem asks you to traverse a matrix graph, or limits you to only movement in one of the two axis at a time, you can assume that getting the distance from X and Y is the safest measure.  ^4fa5fa
- Use hashmaps when needed, or possible.
