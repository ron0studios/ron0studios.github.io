# Greedy algorithms
--- 
> A greedy algorithm is one that approaches a problem by taking the most optimal decision at each step of its processing. 

Greedy algorithms operate by considering only its current step and not the data as a whole. If applicable, this algorithm is potentially very powerful, operating at large scales in pathfinding algorithms and even combinatorics.

However, due to the fact that these algorithms only find local minima instead of a global minima[^1], they tend to be sometimes wrong.

[^1]: A global and local minima refer to points in a problem where a minimum can be reached if consider part of the data. This is often looked on in the perspective of a line [[graph]], where the local minima are small troughs whilst the global minima is the overall limit of the function as x approaches infinity (assuming it has a limit that acts as its absolute minimum value).
