>[!summary] Computer Science **terminology** for an algorithm that can process its input in a *serialised*, *piece-by-piece* fashion. 
>A common example of an *online* algorithm is [[insertion sort]], since it sorts an array by dealing with *inserting* each element into its correct spot in a linear fashion, left-to-right. 
> This is powerful as it allows for you to deal with **streamed** data, or pick up from where you left off with older data.
