## Expected value

The **Expected value** of a probability distribution is the most likely outcome in a given random trial of the distribution on average. It can also be described as the **mean** of the distribution. 
The formula for calculating the expected value is $$\Huge{E[X] = \sum\limits_{x_{i}}{P(X=x_i)x_i}}$$
For example, the probability distribution of a dice roll is $$\begin{array}{|l|l|}\hline x & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ \hline P(X=x) & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{6} & \frac{1}{6}\\ \hline  \end{array}$$
Therefore its expected value would be $$1(\frac{1}{6})+2(\frac{1}{6})+3(\frac{1}{6})+4(\frac{1}{6})+5(\frac{1}{6})+6(\frac{1}{6})=3.5$$
This means that after several successive throws of the dice, the average outcome of the dice rolls will be around ~3.5.
