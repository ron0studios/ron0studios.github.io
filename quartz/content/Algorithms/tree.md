# Tree
>
A tree is a simple kind of [[graph]], where there are **no cycles** and every node has atleast one parent, apart from the root. The outermost nodes are known as **leaves**

A binary tree is one with only 2 children per node. 
A tree is considered **perfect** if all leaves are of the same depth
