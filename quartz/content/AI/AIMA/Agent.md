# Agent
---
>[!summary] An agent is an entity that perceives the environment around it, and acts accordingly based on said goal. 

Examples of an agent include:
- A chess bot
- A self driving car
- Image analysis program
- Language models (like [chatgpt](https://www.chatgpt.com))
Note that agents do not necessarily **have** to be physically present in its environment, like a sci-fi robot. All it needs is some form of *perception of its environment*, and the ability to *act on the environment*.
